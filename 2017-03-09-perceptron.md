## Perceptron

- Perceptron is an algorithm used for classification problems.
- It is supervised learning algorithm (i.e you need to train it using training data before using it)
- Simplest use case is for binary classification
- Allows online learning

Think of perceptron as a black-box for now.

If you train the perceptron box with sufficent training examples, it somehow magically learns to classify the upcoming data.
